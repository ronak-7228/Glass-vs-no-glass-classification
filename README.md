# Problem Statement
Face recognition is a fascinating application in the field of image recognition. The goal of this project is to classify images of people into two classes: Glass vs No-glass based upon whether they are wearing any specs/googles or not . However, there is a variety in the shape, design and appearance of Specs/googles which makes it challenging.
